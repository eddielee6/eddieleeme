But this wasn’t the only crazy change or achievement the year had to offer. Lauren got a new job, I got promoted, Ethan started School, Aurora started Nursery, and we got our first car.</p>\n<p><strong>Fun</strong></p>\n<p><img src="/images/2017-review-family.jpg" alt="Our family">\nWith all this it\'s surprising we had any time for fun, but along with our summer holiday and numerous trips to Thomas Land we managed quite a lot. I even managed to see a whole load of my favourite bands; Blink 182, Green Day, Weezer and Good Charlotte - all in one year.</p>\n<p><strong>Apps</strong></p>\n<p>At the end of last year Glass Umbrella committed to <a href="https://twitter.com/glassumbrellaco/status/815270013808607232">release an app in 2017</a>, well that <a href="https://twitter.com/glassumbrellaco/status/947554224103198720">didn’t happen</a>. However, I can share what I’ve been working on for the last year. Drank is your personal window into understanding the makeup of your daily fluid intake; helping you keep a healthy balance of water, caffeine and alcohol. After a bit of a tidy up and some design work, the app should ship early in 2018.  Until then there is a beta you can join via Twitter DM to <a href="https://twitter.com/thedrankapp">@thedrankapp</a>.\n<img src="/images/2017-review-app.png" alt="Drank App"></p>\n<p>Here\'s looking forward to all 2018 brings, hopefully a bit less change, a lot more relaxing and family time.</p>',timeToRead:1,excerpt:"Following  last years post , I've decided to do another year in review, and 2017 has been one crazy year!
