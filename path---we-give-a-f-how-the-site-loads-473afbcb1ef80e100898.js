Well besides removing the comment from the file, deviantART have now moved to use <a href="http://lesscss.org">LESS</a>, a CSS preprocessor.</p>\n<p>This isn\'t a blog post to talk about the benefits of CSS preprocessors, but as deviantART inform us they cannot stop their developers from swearing in comments, this should stop these developer comments from appearing in served css files again.</p>\n<p><small>Source <a href="http://dt.deviantart.com/journal/We-Give-a-F-How-the-Site-Loads-392679726">deviantART</a></small></p>',timeToRead:1,excerpt:"Looks like some people have been having difficulty with deviantART recently.
