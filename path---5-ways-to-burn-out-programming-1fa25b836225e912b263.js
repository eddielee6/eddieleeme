Think about your project and only the project</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...You put off fun features for the sake of hitting a deadline...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...you started programming because you thought it was fun, why not keep programming because it's fun? Take that little extra time to put in a feature you want...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>2. Have a negative attitude toward everything</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...the best projects I've worked on worked out that way because we had a great, positive team. We enjoyed showing up every day to work, told each other when we did awesome things, held back heavy-handed criticism and phrased it in a productive manner.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>3. Use the tools you know, because you're faster that way</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...you should prototype, play around, and become an expert in new tech...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>4. Switch jobs often</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...Your career stagnates, you don't develop your skills as deeply (only breadth), people don't trust you'll stay employed for a while, and you're constantly having to prove yourself...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>5.

You are the hero. High fives all around. And if you're lucky, you'll get that bonus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That's great the first time. But how about the second. And the third. It's a bomb, and you dont know how short the fuse is.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><small>Source <a href=\"http://blog.braegger.pw/5-ways-to-burn-out-programming\">5 Ways To Burn Out Programming</a></small></p>",timeToRead:1,excerpt:"I've just read a great blog post by  Josh Braegger .
