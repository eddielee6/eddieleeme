Well here\'s the bug report...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I just wanted to let you know that the reason why deviantART\'s CSS isn\'t loading properly for some people is because one of your CSS files has f*** in a stylesheet comment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, a comment in the CSS that included the word "fuck" was being picked up by over overzealous filtering systems, resulting in the file being blocked, and not loaded.</p>\n<p>What was the fix? Well besides removing the comment from the file, deviantART have now moved to use <a href="http://lesscss.org">LESS</a>, a CSS preprocessor.</p>\n<p>This isn\'t a blog post to talk about the benefits of CSS preprocessors, but as deviantART inform us they cannot stop their developers from swearing in comments, this should stop these developer comments from appearing in served css files again.</p>\n<p><small>Source <a href="http://dt.deviantart.com/journal/We-Give-a-F-How-the-Site-Loads-392679726">deviantART</a></small></p>',timeToRead:1}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Fatherhood",tags:["family","personal"],cover:"https://unsplash.it/1152/300/?random?Fatherhood",date:"2013-07-31T23:29",author:"eddie"},fields:{slug:"/fatherhood"},html:'<p>On June 18th 2013 my son was born - this was me becoming a dad at the age of 22.</p>\n<p>At this point, just over one month in, I can happily say its great.</p>\n<p><img src="/images/photos-of-ethan.jpg" alt="Photos of Ethan"></p>\n<p><small>Photo byÂ <a href="http://www.caliteasel.co.uk">Cali Teasel</a></small></p>',timeToRead:1}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Wasted effort",tags:["blog"],cover:"https://unsplash.it/1152/300/?random?WastedEffort",date:"2013-07-31T22:59",author:"eddie"},fields:{slug:"/wasted-effort"},html:'<p>The whois record for this website tells me I registered the domain name on March 11th 2012 at 21:56 - over 12,168 hours ago. In that time I have spent hour upon hour creating endless potential sites, all of which were simply, egotistical displays of my own work and thoughts. None of these designs ever progress further than a prototype, resulting in weeks of my time wasted - time which could have been wiser spent.</p>\n<p>This all boils down to my perception that because I am a software developer, I must create my own website site. That if I use a template or theme it would look bad, like I am incompetent in my own field. This same thought has been in my mind while working on the majority of my past projects - activity avoiding the use of libraries, frameworks and open source code. All this does is slows down progress.</p>\n<p>It is only in the last few months that I have realised the error in my ways. When a user interacts with an application they don\'t see what I see - a duct-taped together collection of libraries, frameworks, and themes - they see a solution to a problem.</p>\n<p>One of the projects I am currently working on along with <a href="https://twitter.com/weiran">Weiran Zhang</a> is called Castr, its a social podcasting app. I wasted several nights the idea that I could style this app myself. This was fantasy; it was never going to work. After many many nights of wasted effort we eventually spent $39 and purchased <a href="http://designmodo.com/flat">Flat UI Pro</a>. Since then progress on the app has skyrocketed.</p>\n<p>Using this same logic I have today, 507 days after buying this domain name, spent $19 and simpley purchased a design. It took me under 10 minutes to get it up and running.</p>',timeToRead:1}}],page:9,pages:9,total:44,limit:5,prev:"/8"}}}});
