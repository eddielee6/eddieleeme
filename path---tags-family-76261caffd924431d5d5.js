It’s surprising how well a children’s TV show from 1997 still holds up today. A lot of it will be nostalgia for me; but Ethan is watching it as a child for the first time over 20 years after its debut - and he loves it.</p>\n<p><img src="/images/pokemon-ethan-book.jpg" alt="Ethan with my old Pokémon book"></p>\n<p>Over the last couple of months he has become obsessed with Pokémon; our house is slowly filling with toys, books, cards, clothes, and a mass of other Pokémon merchandise. It’s really surprising how quickly he’s learnt the names of all the Pokémon, much quicker than learning the far fewer letters of the alphabet a few years previous.</p>\n<p>Its going to be great fun when he’s old enough to play the games; lets see if he can beat me in battle on Pokémon Red and Blue. But for now we’ll stick with the TV show; next up is the emotional rollercoaster of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190641/">Pokémon: The First Movie - Mewtwo Strikes Back</a>.</p>\n<p><img src="/images/pokemon-movie-still.jpg" alt="Pokémon: The First Movie - Mewtwo Strikes Back"></p>',timeToRead:1}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"2017 a year in review",tags:["personal","family"],cover:"https://unsplash.it/1152/300/?random?2017",date:"2017-12-31T23:07",author:"eddie"},fields:{slug:"/2017-a-year-in-review"},html:'<p>Following <a href="http://eddielee.me/its-been-a-year-a-retrospective/">last years post</a>, I\'ve decided to do another year in review, and 2017 has been one crazy year!</p>\n<p><strong>Family</strong></p>\n<p><img src="/images/2017-review-house.jpg" alt="Our house">\nThe overwhelming highlight of this year has been buying and moving into our first family home. But this wasn’t the only crazy change or achievement the year had to offer. Lauren got a new job, I got promoted, Ethan started School, Aurora started Nursery, and we got our first car.</p>\n<p><strong>Fun</strong></p>\n<p><img src="/images/2017-review-family.jpg" alt="Our family">\nWith all this it\'s surprising we had any time for fun, but along with our summer holiday and numerous trips to Thomas Land we managed quite a lot. I even managed to see a whole load of my favourite bands; Blink 182, Green Day, Weezer and Good Charlotte - all in one year.</p>\n<p><strong>Apps</strong></p>\n<p>At the end of last year Glass Umbrella committed to <a href="https://twitter.com/glassumbrellaco/status/815270013808607232">release an app in 2017</a>, well that <a href="https://twitter.com/glassumbrellaco/status/947554224103198720">didn’t happen</a>. However, I can share what I’ve been working on for the last year. Drank is your personal window into understanding the makeup of your daily fluid intake; helping you keep a healthy balance of water, caffeine and alcohol. After a bit of a tidy up and some design work, the app should ship early in 2018.  Until then there is a beta you can join via Twitter DM to <a href="https://twitter.com/thedrankapp">@thedrankapp</a>.\n<img src="/images/2017-review-app.png" alt="Drank App"></p>\n<p>Here\'s looking forward to all 2018 brings, hopefully a bit less change, a lot more relaxing and family time.</p>',timeToRead:1}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"A growing family",tags:["family","personal"],cover:"https://unsplash.it/1152/300/?random?FamilyGrow",date:"2016-08-24T20:08",author:"eddie"},fields:{slug:"/a-growing-family"},html:'<p>Today we welcome a new addition to the family; our daughter Aurora was born this morning at 03:17AM.</p>\n<p><img src="/images/aurora-and-ethan.jpg" alt="Aurora and Ethan"></p>\n<p>Ethan is very excited and sure to be a great big brother.</p>',timeToRead:1}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Lauren and me",tags:["family","personal"],cover:"https://unsplash.it/1152/300/?random?Love",date:"2015-04-19T08:02",author:"eddie"},fields:{slug:"/lauren-and-me"},html:'<p><img src="/images/lauren-me.jpg" alt="Lauren and me"></p>',timeToRead:1}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Asked Lauren to marry me in Central Park today.",tags:["family","personal","New York"],cover:"https://unsplash.it/1152/300/?random?Engaged",date:"2015-02-03T23:25",author:"eddie"},fields:{slug:"/asked-lauren-to-marry-me-in-central-park-today"},html:'<p>She said yes.</p>\n<p><img src="/images/engaged-1.jpg" alt="Central Park"></p>\n<p><img src="/images/engaged-2.jpg" alt="Lauren with her ring"></p>\n<p><img src="/images/engaged-3.jpg" alt="Got Engaged to Lauren Donnelly"></p>',timeToRead:1}}],page:1,pages:2,total:9,limit:5,next:"/tags/family/2"}}}});
