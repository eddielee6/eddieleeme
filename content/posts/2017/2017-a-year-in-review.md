Following [last years post](http://eddielee.me/its-been-a-year-a-retrospective/), I've decided to do another year in review, and 2017 has been one crazy year!

**Family**

The overwhelming highlight of this year has been buying and moving into our first family home. But this wasn’t the only crazy change or achievement the year had to offer. Lauren got a new job, I got promoted, Ethan started School, Aurora started Nursery, and we got our first car.

**Fun**

With all this it's surprising we had any time for fun, but along with our summer holiday and numerous trips to Thomas Land we managed quite a lot. I even managed to see a whole load of my favourite bands; Blink 182, Green Day, Weezer and Good Charlotte - all in one year.

**Apps**

At the end of last year Glass Umbrella committed to [release an app in 2017](https://twitter.com/glassumbrellaco/status/815270013808607232), well that [didn’t happen](https://twitter.com/glassumbrellaco/status/947554224103198720). However, I can share what I’ve been working on for the last year. Drank is your personal window into understanding the makeup of your daily fluid intake; helping you keep a healthy balance of water, caffeine and alcohol. After a bit of a tidy up and some design work, the app should ship early in 2018.  Until then there is a beta you can join via Twitter DM to [@thedrankapp](https://twitter.com/thedrankapp).

Here's looking forward to all 2018 brings, hopefully a bit less change, a lot more relaxing and family time.
