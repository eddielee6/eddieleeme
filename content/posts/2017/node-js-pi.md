*This post assumes your Raspberry Pi is already setup and you can SSH into it. If not, have a Google and come back. I’ll wait.*

The Raspberry Pi Zero (and the original Raspberry Pi) use an ARMv6 CPU. Unfortunately `apt-get install nodejs` installs a version of node built for ARMv7, so we’ll have to install it manually.

## Download
* Download the version of node you want, in this case I’m downloading v7.7.2 for ARMv6. Other versions can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/dist/).

`wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v7.7.2/node-v7.7.2-linux-armv6l.tar.gz`

* Extract the files once the download has completed.

`tar -xzf node-v7.7.2-linux-armv6l.tar.gz`

## Install
* Copy the files into /user/local

`sudo cp -R node-v7.7.2-linux-armv6l/* /usr/local/`

## Add to path
To use the `node` and `npm` commands you need to add the location we installed node (/user/local/bin) to your path.

* Open "~/.profile" for editing (I'm using nano)

`nano ~/.profile`

* Add `PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin` at the end then press `ctrl + x` to exit. Type `yes` to save.

## Clean up 
We should now remove the downloaded files to keep the file system clean.

* Remove the tarball

`rm ~/node-v7.7.2-linux-armv6l.tar.gz `

* Remove the extracted files

`rm -r ~/node-v7.7.2-linux-armv6l`

## Test
* Check that node is working with `node -v` which will return the installed version, in my case v7.7.2.
* Check that npm is working with `npm -v` which will return the installed version, in my case v4.1.2.
