The latest episode of The Incomparable is fantastic; [episode 410 - I Am Not a Crackpot](https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/410/). It's a draft of the best Simpsons Quotes with [Jason Snell](https://www.theincomparable.com/person/jason-snell/) with [Glenn Fleishman](https://www.theincomparable.com/person/glenn-fleishman/), [Philip Michaels](https://www.theincomparable.com/person/philip-michaels/), [John Siracusa](https://www.theincomparable.com/person/john-siracusa/), and [Monty Ashley](https://www.theincomparable.com/person/monty-ashley/).

There are some absolutely classic Simpsons episodes, and many many fantastic quotes (mainly in the first 10 seasons). After listening to this podcast I had to try and put together some of my own favourite Simpsons quotes.

I tried to do a top 10, so here are 22â€¦
