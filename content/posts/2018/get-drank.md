How much Caffeine did you drink yesterday? How many units of alcohol did you consume last weekend? Did you drink enough water today? The answer to these questions for a lot of people is often too much of the bad stuff, and not enough of the good stuff.

Using [the Drank app](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/drank/id1224749685?mt=8&amp;ct=eddieleeme) over the last few months has allowed me to improve the balance of what I drink. I knew I drank a lot of caffeine, but until I saw it charted in Drank I wasn’t aware it was over 80% of my daily water intake, sometimes drinking in excess of 10 cups a day.

Today we’re proud to release Drank to the world!

Give Drank a go. Gain insights, and drink better.

Available now for iOS and coming soon for Android.
