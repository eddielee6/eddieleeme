The new album; Post Traumatic by Mike Shinoda is absolutely fantastic. Some of his solo work in the past has been pretty good, but every single track on this album is unquestionably excellent!!

It really fucking sucked when Chester died last year - this album is a very raw show of grief layed out as the album progresses. Well worth a listen...
