Fathers Day in so many respects is such contrived bullshit; but I love it. Not for gifts or a lazy day - for little things, like the kids running in to wake me up; making sure I haven't forgotten it's Fathers Day. Bringing me handmade cards, funny cards, personalised gifts, and fun activities to do together.

Fathers Day is great!

This photo frame really made my day!
