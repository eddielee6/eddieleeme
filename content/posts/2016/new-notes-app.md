Due to sync issues my [faith in Apple's Notes app has been shaken](http://eddielee.me/notes-woes/). I'm aware I can most likely fix this by turning the iCloud toggle on and off on each platform, but I shouldn't have to. So I'm looking for a replacement.

My requirements are:

* Simple
* iPhone, iPad, and macOS
* Plain text
* Markdown
* **Flawless sync**

Bonus

* Code snippets
* Inline images

So far I have shorted listed these...

* [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer)
* [Ulysses](https://ulyssesapp.com)
* [Byword](https://bywordapp.com)

If anyone has any other recommendations tweet me [@eddielee6](https://twitter.com/eddielee6).

*(Side note: I opened Notes on my MacBook while writing this to copy the shortlist I wrote on my iPhone - and it wasn't there...)*
