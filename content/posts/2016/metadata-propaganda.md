There has been a lot of talk recently about Russia and potential interference with the US presidential election. I don’t know if this is true; I suspect it is, but it’s not my place to say. What I do know is I’ve started to see a lot of odd data reported by Google Analytics; mainly pro-Trump messages set as peoples browser languages…

Where does this traffic originate? Russia. I post nothing in Russian, I have no genuine Russian readers that I know of. But Google Analytics reports nearly all of this data from there.

No conclusions can really be drawn from this, but it’s interesting regardless.
