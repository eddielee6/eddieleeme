 - A Year of Apps
---
Writing the opening post for this *"a year of apps"*Â series I had what I would have previously treated as an unrecoverable setback. I lost the post.

After spending 20 minutes crafting the perfect post in the Tumblr iOS app, I decided to put it down, think it over, and make a cup of tea before posting. In the interim I used a few other apps, and when I returned the app had reset and the post was gone.

Forcing myself to writing the post again (all be it a lot shorter) and not giving up with the challenge can only be a good sign of things to come.
