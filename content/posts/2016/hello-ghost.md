I've spent the weekend migrating my blog from its old home on [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com) to a self-hosted version of [Ghost](https://ghost.org/developers) on [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/338b102147a6). While the $5/month for a Digital Ocean server is more than a free Tumblr account, the advantages are worth it.

* I have full control over the site
* I can easily customise all aspects of the design
* I own the content 
* [I have no fear of Yahoo shutting me down](http://www.zdnet.com/article/yahoo-reports-another-big-loss-and-tumblr-write-down/)
* No one is injecting ads

Plus, it's been a great opportunity to brush up on my Linux skills.
