Over the bank holiday weekend I put together a web app - [Carpark Space Finder](http://carpark-space-finder.herokuapp.com).

Using Nottinghamâ€™s Open Data APIs, the app shows many many spaces the carpark has and how many are free.

The app is available [here](http://carpark-space-finder.herokuapp.com), and the source can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/eddielee6/CarparkSpaceFinder).
