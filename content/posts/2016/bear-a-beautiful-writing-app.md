I've spent the last few days looking for a new note taking and general writing app after [falling out with](http://eddielee.me/notes-woes/) Apple’s Notes app.

The one I've settled on, and has massively exceeded my expectations of what to expect from an iOS writing app is [Bear](http://www.bear-writer.com). In my [last blog post](http://eddielee.me/new-notes-app/) I shortlisted several apps I was thinking of moving to, but had missed Bear. Luckily [Weiran Zhang](https://twitter.com/weiran/status/813909062135869440) recommended it to me on Twitter.

Bear has the best Markdown support of any app I’ve used, desktop or mobile - and this app works on both. Notes are easily categorised with hashtags. And so far, the sync between my iPhone and Mac has been flawless.

The app is free with payments of either £1.49/month or £13.99/year for Bear Pro which includes sync.
