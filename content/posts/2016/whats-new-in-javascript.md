Last Monday I did my public first talk outside of work life. A short 20 minute presentation on modern JavaScript features at a local .net developer meet-up - [dot net notts](https://www.meetup.com/dotnetnotts/events/226457574/).

I had no slides, the talk was comprised of live coding with prepared examples showing off the five areas of ES2015 I think bring the biggest change to the language.

* Variables
* Template Strings
* Arrow Functions
* Spread and Rest
* Generators

The talk went fairly well, with the forgivingness of JavaScript helping me out on more than one occasion. Hopefully many more of these to come.
