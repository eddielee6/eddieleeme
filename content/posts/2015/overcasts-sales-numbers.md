**[Overcast’s 2014 sales numbers – Marco.org](http://www.marco.org/2015/01/15/overcast-sales-numbers)**

Very positive post from Marco Arment about the revenue generated by his latest app Overcast. Particularly this part of the last paragraph.

> I'm probably coming in under what I could get at a good full-time job in the city, but I don't have to actually work for someone else on something I don't care about. I can work in my nice home office, drink my fussy coffee, take a nap after lunch if I want to, and be present for my family as my kid grows up. That's my definition of success.
