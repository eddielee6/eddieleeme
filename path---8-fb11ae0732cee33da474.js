Well besides removing the comment from the file, deviantART have now moved to use <a href="http://lesscss.org">LESS</a>, a CSS preprocessor.</p>\n<p>This isn\'t a blog post to talk about the benefits of CSS preprocessors, but as deviantART inform us they cannot stop their developers from swearing in comments, this should stop these developer comments from appearing in served css files again.</p>\n<p><small>Source <a href="http://dt.deviantart.com/journal/We-Give-a-F-How-the-Site-Loads-392679726">deviantART</a></small></p>',timeToRead:1}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Fatherhood",tags:["family","personal"],cover:"https://unsplash.it/1152/300/?random?Fatherhood",date:"2013-07-31T23:29",author:"eddie"},fields:{slug:"/fatherhood"},html:'<p>On June 18th 2013 my son was born - this was me becoming a dad at the age of 22.</p>\n<p>At this point, just over one month in, I can happily say its great.</p>\n<p><img src="/images/photos-of-ethan.jpg" alt="Photos of Ethan"></p>\n<p><small>Photo by <a href="http://www.caliteasel.co.uk">Cali Teasel</a></small></p>',timeToRead:1}}],page:8,pages:9,total:41,limit:5,prev:"/7",next:"/9"}}}});
