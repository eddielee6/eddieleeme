No matter how many iterations of the game were created, no matter what was tried, I could not gamify Bug Hunt. I could not make it fun. Because of this, after nearly 3 months of development I stopped working on the app. I had pledged to release everything I worked on in the year, but what use is a game that isn’t fun?</p>\\n<p>Fortunately; building, building and rebuilding the game time after time was a great opportunity to improve my understanding of Swift, Sprite Kit, and all of iOS.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"other-projects\\\"><a href=\\\"#other-projects\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Other projects</h3>\\n<p>While I did not attempt any other major solo projects in the year, I did work on some with other people.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"parkr\\\"><a href=\\\"#parkr\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Parkr</h4>\\n<p>After the false start which was Bug Hunt, the next project started was strictly MVP. A weekend of hacking led me to shipping <a href=\\\"http://eddielee.me/presenting-carpark-space-finder/\\\">Carpark Space Finder</a>. Following this, I set out along with <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/paulwallas\\\">Paul Wallas</a> on evolving this into <em>Parkr</em>, a full carpark space tracking service. While development fizzled out when I started my new job, we still hope to ship improvements to the MVP in the new year.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/images/retrospective-parkr.png\\\" alt=\\\"Parkr\\\"></p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"next-level-events\\\"><a href=\\\"#next-level-events\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Next Level Events</h4>\\n<p>At the start of the year I set out along with <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/tanneroni\\\">Tanner</a> and <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/weiran\\\">Weiran</a> on building an <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/nle_uk\\\">events management system</a>.

The logic behind this was to break myself out of the cycle of always coding, but never shipping.</p>\\n<p>Well, I did not ship 12 projects - <em>it was closer to 2</em>. This isn’t to say the concept was a failure. I did - as always - start many projects, and I did release more than I have in previous years.

I attempted to create a game I codenamed \\\"Bug Hunt\\\". In the game, the user controls a spider who shoots webs at various insects who attempt to cross the screen. I enlisted the help of designer <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/paulwallas\\\">Paul Wallas</a> who created some fantastic assets for the game.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/images/retrospective-bug-hunt.png\\\" alt=\\\"Bug Hunt\\\"></p>\\n<p>Many issues arose during this project, not to do with coding, graphics or free time - but the concept itself. No matter how many iterations of the game were created, no matter what was tried, I could not gamify Bug Hunt. I could not make it fun. Because of this, after nearly 3 months of development I stopped working on the app. I had pledged to release everything I worked on in the year, but what use is a game that isn’t fun?</p>\\n<p>Fortunately; building, building and rebuilding the game time after time was a great opportunity to improve my understanding of Swift, Sprite Kit, and all of iOS.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"other-projects\\\"><a href=\\\"#other-projects\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Other projects</h3>\\n<p>While I did not attempt any other major solo projects in the year, I did work on some with other people.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"parkr\\\"><a href=\\\"#parkr\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Parkr</h4>\\n<p>After the false start which was Bug Hunt, the next project started was strictly MVP.
