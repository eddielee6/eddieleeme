In short this is now one of my favourite Lego sets. I first heard of this set on Hello Internet <a href="http://www.hellointernet.fm/podcast/89">episode 89</a>. Then a few months later after rewatching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112384/">Apollo 13</a> I decided I had to have it.</p>\n<p><img src="/images/lego-saturn-v-box.jpg" alt="Lego Saturn V in Box"></p>\n<p>The box this set comes in is huge, but is nothing compared to the size of the built rocket. When complete it stands a meter high (1:110 scale of the real thing) and contains nearly 2000 bricks; making it pretty heavy. You don’t realise from looking at it, but it’s actually solid inside; this isn’t a hollow shell.</p>\n<p><img src="/images/lego-saturn-v-vertical.jpg" alt="Lego Saturn V built"></p>\n<p>There are some great finishing touches to the set as well; like the Luna Lander, and a recreation of the command Module splashing down in the ocean. There really is a lot of detail in this set, and unlike most sets all details are printed onto the bricks; no stickers!!</p>\n<p>The rocket fully separates into its first, second, and third stages; plus the Luna Lander and Command Module fit inside the Payload Fairing.</p>\n<table class="image-split">\n    <tr>\n        <td>\n            <img src="/images/lego-saturen-v-lander.jpg" alt="Lego Saturn V Luna Lander">\n        </td>\n        <td>\n            <img src="/images/lego-saturn-v-splash.jpg" alt="Lego Saturn V Command Module">\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n<p>I’m really impressed with how easily Ethan managed to put this set together. The set places itself in the 14+ age range; but even while I was struggling to work out what parts of the instructions were saying Ethan was plowing ahead with the build.</p>\n<p><img src="/images/lego-saturn-v-build.jpg" alt="Building Lego Saturn V Rocket"></p>\n<p>Great fun; I can’t wait for our <a href="https://shop.lego.com/en-GB/garmadon-Garmadon-GARMADON-70656">next build</a>!</p>',timeToRead:1,excerpt:"Ethan and myself have spent many evenings over the last few weeks assembling the  LEGO® NASA Apollo Saturn V  rocket.
