But this wasn’t the only crazy change or achievement the year had to offer. Lauren got a new job, I got promoted, Ethan started School, Aurora started Nursery, and we got our first car.</p>\n<p><strong>Fun</strong></p>\n<p><img src="/images/2017-review-family.jpg" alt="Our family">\nWith all this it\'s surprising we had any time for fun, but along with our summer holiday and numerous trips to Thomas Land we managed quite a lot. I even managed to see a whole load of my favourite bands; Blink 182, Green Day, Weezer and Good Charlotte - all in one year.</p>\n<p><strong>Apps</strong></p>\n<p>At the end of last year Glass Umbrella committed to <a href="https://twitter.com/glassumbrellaco/status/815270013808607232">release an app in 2017</a>, well that <a href="https://twitter.com/glassumbrellaco/status/947554224103198720">didn’t happen</a>. However, I can share what I’ve been working on for the last year. Drank is your personal window into understanding the makeup of your daily fluid intake; helping you keep a healthy balance of water, caffeine and alcohol. After a bit of a tidy up and some design work, the app should ship early in 2018.  Until then there is a beta you can join via Twitter DM to <a href="https://twitter.com/thedrankapp">@thedrankapp</a>.\n<img src="/images/2017-review-app.png" alt="Drank App"></p>\n<p>Here\'s looking forward to all 2018 brings, hopefully a bit less change, a lot more relaxing and family time.</p>',timeToRead:1}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"A growing family",tags:["family","personal"],cover:"https://unsplash.it/1152/300/?random?FamilyGrow",date:"2016-08-24T20:08",author:"eddie"},fields:{slug:"/a-growing-family"},html:'<p>Today we welcome a new addition to the family; our daughter Aurora was born this morning at 03:17AM.</p>\n<p><img src="/images/aurora-and-ethan.jpg" alt="Aurora and Ethan"></p>\n<p>Ethan is very excited and sure to be a great big brother.</p>',timeToRead:1}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Lauren and me",tags:["family","personal"],cover:"https://unsplash.it/1152/300/?random?Love",date:"2015-04-19T08:02",author:"eddie"},fields:{slug:"/lauren-and-me"},html:'<p><img src="/images/lauren-me.jpg" alt="Lauren and me"></p>',timeToRead:1}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Asked Lauren to marry me in Central Park today.",tags:["family","personal","New York"],cover:"https://unsplash.it/1152/300/?random?Engaged",date:"2015-02-03T23:25",author:"eddie"},fields:{slug:"/asked-lauren-to-marry-me-in-central-park-today"},html:'<p>She said yes.</p>\n<p><img src="/images/engaged-1.jpg" alt="Central Park"></p>\n<p><img src="/images/engaged-2.jpg" alt="Lauren with her ring"></p>\n<p><img src="/images/engaged-3.jpg" alt="Got Engaged to Lauren Donnelly"></p>',timeToRead:1}},{node:{frontmatter:{title:"Family",tags:["family","personal"],cover:"https://unsplash.it/1152/300/?random?Family",date:"2015-01-11T16:06",author:"eddie"},fields:{slug:"/family"},html:'<p>Great photo of Lauren and Ethan</p>\n<p><img src="/images/lauren-ethan.jpg" alt="Ethan and Lauren"></p>',timeToRead:1}}],page:1,pages:2,total:8,limit:5,next:"/tags/family/2"}}}});
